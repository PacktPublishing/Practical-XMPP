#Practical XMPP
This is the code repository for [Practical XMPP](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/practical-xmpp?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781785287985), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
modules_enabled = {
"roster";
"saslauth";
"tls";
"dialback";
"disco";
"version";
"uptime";
"time";
"ping",
"register";
"posix";
"bosh";
};
```

The requirements for all sections of this book after fairly minimal. Any computer built within the past five years that supports a recent version of Linux, Mac, or Windows will be sufficient. An up-to-date browser will be required for websocket support, but even then the project is able to fall back to standard HTTP. You machine should have at least 128 Mb of free RAM and the same amount of hard drive space.
